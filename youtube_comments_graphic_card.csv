{"cid": "UgzMw7G2iqqh8uxnl6V4AaABAg", "text": "Many commenters do not realize that memory alone does not mean higher quality or better performance, now or in the future. This video perfectly shows how important technical progress is and how it affects the development of the technologies we use. Just look at the fact that other cards also have more memory, which does not mean that they have stood the test of time. If we are to rely solely on the amount of VRAM, we can say that 1080Ti or even 2080Ti should be better than 4060. Coming to the essence of the matter, many people only look at the numbers and do not realize that drivers, technical design, newer controllers, newer APIs are more important because the GPU can use its power more effectively. Likewise, we forget that developers optimizing their productions will not bother with GPU that is 3-4 years old or more, they will optimize their productions based on the latest architecture, which is why, among other things, slower RAM and its smaller amount do not affect lower performance. RTX 3060 is only better when you currently have it in terms of replacing the GPU, if you are building a new computer, never go back a few years because a few numbers are higher. Of course, we are talking about the case assuming a given budget, if you currently have a top-shelf GPU and you want a budget GPU, for it to be worth changing, you have to wait 2 and sometimes even 3 generations.", "time": "hace 1 mes", "author": "@danielmazi1090", "channel": "UC2RpCF2eTx0CAdLUfpLZb1g", "votes": "5", "replies": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_l2iKzRfhItUJlGKK683VwUc0xqcQFJeAQOj7X2937yzw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": true, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1728920374.733537}

I recomend you watching some benchmarks i5 12400F + 4060 and you will see love at first sight, after testing like at least tens of PC configurations for budget between 800$ and 1200 I found this great combo.. Why so great? I l explain and you can see in benchmarks also,  first of all a 32 gb is a must for lower temperatures and smoother calibrations of games, you will see the magic... Like I never seen the GPU getting over 70 Celsius in ultra settings and CPU most of times never goes over 60 Celsius... Secondly, the FPS rarely gets under 100 in many games, exceptions  AW, MFS, Red Dead etc... I simply love it and hopefully I l see that soon when it will arive home.. Is probably best combo for budget lower than thousands $. I think is always the bending between the CPU and GPU, if you use a strong CPU like I9 etc, the temperatures will go over like at least 5 Celsius above and FPS sometimes go lower.. It needs to be in perfect harmony, never big differences between CPU and GPU... +As I said, 32 gb Ram is always a must, never different freqencies and try one slot or maximum 2:).

Even though the 4060 has little VRAM, older cards were not always able to use this VRAM. Therefore, in 90% of cases, the 4060, despite the smaller amount of memory, is better than the 3060 12GB. My advice is to buy what someone can afford because prices vary depending on the region. In my case, the RX6700XT is about $50 more expensive than the 4060, which is a big difference, and used cards such as the 3070 are much more expensive than the new 4060. And not everyone wants a card from AMD, I also choose RTX over RX precisely because not only high numbers matter, but software changes a lot. As for the frame generator, the increase in memory consumption is not large, about 200-300 MB, so if the game uses around 7GB of VRAM, you can safely use it and gain a lot in terms of FPS. It should also be remembered that the cards from the ..60 series were not created with longevity in mind, these are budget cards and if we want to have a card for more than 2 or 3 years, we have to take into account higher expenses. Coming to the point, I recommend buying a card that you can afford, I personally will always choose the newer technology over the older one if we are talking about the same price (as in the case of 3060 and 4060).", "time": "hace 4 semanas", "author": "@danielmazi1090", "channel": "UC2RpCF2eTx0CAdLUfpLZb1g", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_l2iKzRfhItUJlGKK683VwUc0xqcQFJeAQOj7X2937yzw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1729179575.845095}

Higher VRAM capacity can significantly impact rendering performance‚Äîthe more, the better.

The RTX 4060, with its higher CUDA core count, can still excel despite its lower VRAM capacity. You'll only need higher VRAM if you're handling larger projects with extensive scenes and heavy textures.\n\nIn terms of future-proofing, a higher VRAM size can make your GPU more future-proof. The RTX 3060 12GB can be considered future-proof in terms of VRAM size. However, the RTX 4060 is also future-proof due to its newer architecture, which may offer better compatibility with newer software and longer support from NVIDIA compared to the RTX 3060.\n\nRegarding power consumption, the RTX 4060 consumes less power than the RTX 3060 due to its newer architecture.

Also I forgot to mention that I do indeed think the RTX 4060 has a few things going for it. It's extremely power efficient, It's nice for upscaling thanks to DLSS and it does indeed have frame generation. Even if the VRAM kinda limits framegen in many cases. So far I have no issues doing 1440p with it in the modern games I have. Upscaling and textures a notch down and I have 60 fps +. It's not a bad card, but I think it should have been cheaper for what it is. But then again, graphics cards are kinda overpriced. Also, in this video it is very clear that the RTX 4060 is quite a bit better VS the 3060. Even though it's nice that the 3060 has 12GB VRAM, in many cases it doesn't have the GPU power to back up that VRAM.", "time": "hace 4 meses", "author": "@larsenmats", "channel": "UCZrHuBFO2nRnE28sUz81T3Q", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/fAVXI7pzildw8nJQzJWG3uE7Ph2jnZf4UPgVjWpAX6-BaVzf734d7fxNQD2ThyWYclcSEPG2Lw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1720971582.942937}

If we put frame generation aside, I'm not sure why 4060 would still be performing 40% better in this selection of recent AAA games.    The cynic in me says the game devs and nvidia driver devs have worked with each other to make certain optimisations only for the new gen, and perhaps excluded those optimisations from previous gen.    This would be convenient as it shows off how much better the new gen is, which in turn creates more demand for them.    The previous gen has 50% more ram, 50% wider memory bus, 16% more cuda cores, but 38% slower clock speed.   Could it be that the latest AAA games just favour clockspeed above all else?

{"cid": "Ugx-4S913u2M0x7Yhcd4AaABAg", "text": "The reason nvidia and amd won't give you good budget options is because why bother? People often defend the 4060 by saying its efficient and the performance is ''good enough''. Its not. Nobody even points out that from specs and performance, its more akin to a 4050ti. I mean I've seen people even defend the 8gb of vram. Why bother releasing good value cards? Nvidia realized their ''mistake'' when they made pascal too good. They aren't going to repeat that. And trust me, AMD made the same mistake with rx6000. They're no better than nvidia overall. They too will follow nvidia's example. \n\nThe rx5500xt, 6500xt and 3050 all have had 8gb of vram. Thats 3 generations of xx50 class having 8gb of vram. Its about time they got a boost. 4060 should've been a 4050ti with a 160bit bus and 10gb of vram. That too with a 75w version and 100w version, so we can actually utilize its efficiency. 4050 should've been the laptop 4050 but with a 128bit bus and 8gb of vram. And had a 75w and 90w version. I mean the 1050 and 1650 had this. \n\nBut, I don't think the future of 8gb cards will be as bleak some people say because what games you play dictate how much vram you'll need. AAA games suck in general. From being just interactive movies to unoptimized ports to incredibly boring in general, why bother? A lot of folks are shifting to modding older games, playing older titles or just playing indie titles. \n\nBesides, upgrade cycles have increased now as well. And likely will continue given how things are going. I mean the fact, that pascal, which is 7 years old now, is STILL relevant, to the point that remedy had to optimize AW2 specifically for pascal, just goes to show how little people have started to care about new AAA titles. \n\nI wouldn't suggest waiting on the rtx 5000 series considering the 5060 will be another crap 128bit 8gb card.", "time": "hace 5 meses", "author": "@siyzerix", "channel": "UCbwQo-8K35A_Xe5WJGlRk2A", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/MwLjqXINsS-GukNuEtmQBMT9RytfoCNGEb0YzZWJ78NbnWpxdCXDWlxpTvmL7PJvTXTYXGECeQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1718379586.753189}

For all we know it could be the game which cannot, or does not, take advantage of it.    What do you store in VRAM?   What is VRAM for primarily?   What does it help with?   Rasterisation at higher resolutions?   Keeping textures and assets in memory to avoid having to swap them to system RAM?   Do you need a specific clockspeed to take advantage of VRAM?  (clockspeed is 4060's main hardware advantage it seems).   I'm asking because in other tests on other channel with Cyberpunk there were less microstutters on 3060 which youtuber attributed to higher VRAM --  3060 was actively using 10GB and 4060 was using 6GB.    But I have no idea if VRAM was the reason, for all I know it could just be a baseless claim.   \"Oh look, 3060 has more memory, and it's running better, so it must be the memory\".

Some games might be very efficient at swapping things between system RAM and VRAM, or not have much swapping to do simply because the subject matter of the game doesn't require much swapping.   Open world game probably does more dynamic streaming of assets and could benefit more from VRAM.

I went to another village and my ram was at 17-18GB of ram used from 12-13GB because it ram out of vram and frame generation uses also vram. That beginning scene is extremely easy to run with 8GB of vram but the longer you play the more vram it uses. The only way i dont get stuttering with the vram is if I run medium textures.", "time": "hace 6 meses (editado)", "author": "@BladeCrew", "channel": "UCFOgUKTXnsM0c3HjL81WeLw", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/BwAANpMJAdia1iuYV8sjm7k-BBC3S7SW9mvlPX8g6Kl34tC0zTSP1O3PkHKbD4JzXLvpUzxfxWs=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1715701195.345005}

So, in fact, 4070 S is the first 4000 card worth considering from the value perspective. Nvidia did a great job to upsell people.

The vram that would cost a tiny fraction of the cost of a GPU.
